Statement of Purpose (Computer Science & Engineering)
The boundless possibility of trying out and the instant knowledge of the outcome that stimulates one for
further analysis of a rationale in question is what I find most appealing about Computer Science. Keeping
up an inquisitive and explorative attitude, I believe, leads to a constant learning process. This approach
adds to the already immense potential for innovation that exists in this field.
Science & Engineering, I look to graduate study to refine my knowledge and skills in my areas of interest.
I believe it will also serve to give direction to my goal of a career as a research professional at an
academic or commercial, research-oriented organization. I intend to pursue an MS degree in order to
reach that goal.
that has given me a comprehensive exposure to the core areas of Computer Science and a strong
conceptual understanding of the same. In these three and half years of study, I have strived to maintain
an approach of expending independent effort in all my endeavors. Learning by myself and sharing my
knowledge with others has been most worthwhile, when 
comprehending a concept.
Over the past two years, I have an interest in the areas of Compiler Construction for C++ programs 


my MS degree, I remain open to other topics as well.
For my B.E project, I have decided to concentrate on my other area of interest viz. Information Retrieval.
I’m attempting to evolve a technique that, when employed in a search engine, will maximize the
comprehensiveness and precision of the query listings. The ongoing work has introduced me to a vast
body of pertinent research, such as the University of Washington’s Dynamic Reference Sifting technique
for locating an individual’s homepage, among others. This has served to sharpen my inclination to
engage in active research within this area.
